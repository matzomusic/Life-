# MZ's Game of Life

## Based on Conway's Game of Life except there are life stages, each with different rules.

#### Hover over the screen to kill cells, and hold the mouse down to add new cells.

#### P: Pause
#### R: restart
#### Backspace: clear

###  <br>
### This is the pattern that sets off a sprawling structure. The rotation doesn't matter. I call it an egg:
##### ![egg](resources/bug%20egg.png)
## <br>

### The egg then proceeeds to hatch and create this formation. I call it a bug:
##### ![hatching](resources/bug%20hatching.png)
## <br>
### ...once this structure is formed it's very difficult to clear the entire grid, and the behaviour resembles a real ecosystem.
